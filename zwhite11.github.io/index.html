            an actual device. It was created with Android Studio version 2.3.2.
            The contents of the build.gradle file are below. QuickMaths was

          <p class="projectDescription">
            Pizzapolis is a mock pizza ordering application created as a final
            group project for the course “Web Application Development with Java”
            offered at Johns Hopkins University (605.782). It was developed in
            Netbeans IDE using HTML, JSP, JavaScript, and Java Servlets for it’s
            front-end UI. Pizzapolis uses JavaScript for short-term client-side
            persistence. It also uses MySQL and Hibernate ORM for it’s long-term
            server-side persistence layer. The application also sends order
            confirmation email using JavaMail API and Javax. JSON and invisible
            form entries are used to pass data from client to server.

            QuickMaths is a two player game in which players compete on the same
            screen to solve basic math equations. The player who correctly
            answers the most equations correctly is the winner. QuickMaths is
            very basic without any sort of options or customization. Included
            are all the files necessary to run the QuickMaths Android app. The
            app can be run on an emulator or an actual device. It was created
            with Android Studio version 2.3.2. The contents of the build.gradle
            file are below. QuickMaths was successfully run in Android Studio
            with Nexus 5x emulator (API 24).
